# Epic 1: Template Foundation System

**Goal:** Establish the core template generation system, DNA architecture, and
fundamental infrastructure required for all subsequent template development.

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Monorepo Structure with Shared Tooling

As a template system architect, I want a monorepo structure with shared tooling
so that all templates maintain consistency and can be atomically updated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC: Monorepo established with Nx or Lerna for workspace management
- AC: Shared ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configurations across all packages
- AC: Unified build, test, and deployment scripts for all templates
- AC: Dependency management strategy preventing version conflicts

### Story 1.2: CLI Tool for Template Selection

As a developer using templates, I want a CLI tool for template selection and
instantiation so that I can quickly create new projects with zero manual
configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC: CLI tool supports interactive template selection with filtering and search
- AC: Template instantiation completes in <2 minutes with all dependencies
  resolved
- AC: Generated projects include complete development environment setup
- AC: CLI provides clear feedback and error handling for common issues

### Story 1.3: DNA Module System

As a template creator, I want a DNA module system so that I can compose reusable
components across different templates efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC: DNA modules have standardized interfaces for authentication, payments,
  real-time features
- AC: DNA composition engine validates compatibility and resolves conflicts
- AC: Templates can be generated with custom DNA combinations
- AC: Documentation automatically generated for DNA module combinations

### Story 1.4: Automated Testing Infrastructure

As a quality assurance engineer, I want automated testing infrastructure so that
all templates maintain 80%+ test coverage and zero critical vulnerabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC: Framework-specific testing templates (Flutter widgets, React Native
  components, web unit tests)
- AC: Automated security scanning with Snyk/npm audit integration
- AC: Code coverage reporting with historical trend tracking
- AC: Quality gates prevent template publication below standards
