# Starter Template DNA App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal, Objective and Context

**Primary Goal:** Create the ultimate developer's toolkit - a comprehensive

## Initial Architect Prompt

Based on our comprehensive analysis and requirements for the Starter Template
DNA App, I've compiled the following technical guidance to inform your
architecture creation:

### Technical Infrastructure Priority

**Repository & Service Architecture Decision:** Monorepo with
microservices-ready modular architecture enabling shared tooling, consistent
versioning, and atomic updates while maintaining clear boundaries for
independent evolution and deployment flexibility.

**AI-Native Architecture Requirements:** Templates must include production-ready
LLM integration with multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models),
vector database patterns for RAG implementation, streaming response handling
without UI blocking, and comprehensive cost optimization strategies including
token management and caching.

**Modular DNA System Design:** Create pluggable component architecture with
standardized interfaces for authentication, payments, real-time features, AI
integration, testing infrastructure, and security frameworks. DNA composition
engine must validate compatibility and resolve conflicts automatically.

### Framework-Specific Technical Guidance

**Flutter Leadership Strategy:** Leverage Flutter's comprehensive testing
ecosystem (5/5 research rating) as primary framework for maximum template
quality. Implement widget testing, integration testing, golden file visual
regression, and hot reload testing optimization.

**React Native Enterprise Integration:** Utilize mature JavaScript ecosystem
with Jest + Detox testing combination, extensive mocking capabilities, and
enterprise-grade CI/CD integration for maximum adoption potential.

**Tauri Performance Optimization:** Deploy for performance-critical applications
requiring 2.5-3MB bundles vs 80-120MB Electron alternative, with <500ms startup
time and hybrid Rust + web testing approaches.

### Quality Assurance Architecture

**Testing-First Development:** Implement framework-specific comprehensive
testing setups with automated quality gates, 80%+ code coverage requirements,
security vulnerability scanning integration, and performance regression
detection.

**Anti-Technical Debt Mechanisms:** Integrate automated refactoring tools, code
smell detection and remediation, architecture compliance checking for template
pattern enforcement, and documentation generation with maintenance automation.

### AI Integration Technical Requirements

**Security-First Design:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning
integration, input sanitization for AI interactions, output validation
preventing prompt injection, secure secret management, and encryption at rest
and in transit.

**Compliance Architecture Preparation:** Design template foundation supporting
future HIPAA (healthcare), SOC2 (enterprise), and financial regulatory
compliance requirements with audit trail capabilities and data governance
patterns.

### Performance & Scalability Requirements

**Cross-Platform Performance:** <10 minute setup time requirement, hot reload <3
seconds, full build <5 minutes for complex templates, and runtime performance
meeting or exceeding baseline framework characteristics.

**Scalability Architecture:** Templates must support scaling from prototype to
enterprise production with clear migration paths, load balancing capabilities,
and auto-scaling configuration for cloud deployment.

### DevOps & Deployment Integration

**CI/CD Pipeline Architecture:** GitHub Actions optimization for multi-platform
builds, automated testing across device matrices, security scanning with
blocking capabilities, and deployment automation for cloud providers and app
stores.

**Template Evolution System:** Automated template updates with migration
