# Progress Tracking System

## Development Session Tracking

### Session Metadata

- **Start Time**: Automatically logged when AI assistant begins work
- **End Time**: Logged when session concludes
- **Developer**: GitHub username or identifier
- **Session Type**: Feature development, bug fix, refactoring, testing,
  documentation
- **AI Assistant**: Model and version used (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4)

### Progress Metrics

```json
{
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "startTime": "2025-01-06T10:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2025-01-06T12:30:00Z",
  "developer": "developer-username",
  "aiAssistant": "claude-sonnet-4",
  "sessionType": "feature-development",
  "epic": "epic-1",
  "stories": ["epic-1-story-3", "epic-1-story-4"],
  "metrics": {
    "linesAdded": 247,
    "linesDeleted": 32,
    "filesModified": 8,
    "testsAdded": 15,
    "testsCoverage": 85.2,
    "securityIssuesFixed": 2,
    "performanceOptimizations": 1
  },
  "qualityGates": {
    "linting": "passed",
    "typechecking": "passed",
    "tests": "passed",
    "security": "passed",
    "coverage": "passed"
  }
}
```

### Friction Points Tracking

- **Setup Time**: Time from session start to productive coding
- **Blockers Encountered**: Dependencies, unclear requirements, technical issues
- **Context Switching**: Time spent understanding existing code
- **Resolution Time**: Time to resolve each blocker

### Success Indicators

- Setup time < 10 minutes (target achieved)
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities introduced
- Test coverage maintained above 80%
- All quality gates passed before session end
- Technical debt not increased (measured by cyclomatic complexity)

## Story and Epic Progress

### Story Status Tracking

```typescript
interface StoryProgress {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  epic: string;
  status: 'not-started' | 'in-progress' | 'code-complete' | 'testing' | 'done';
  assignedDeveloper?: string;
  aiAssistant?: string;
  startDate?: Date;
  completionDate?: Date;
  estimatedHours: number;
  actualHours?: number;
  dependencies: string[];
  blockers: Blocker[];
  qualityMetrics: QualityMetrics;
}

interface Blocker {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  reportedDate: Date;
  resolvedDate?: Date;
  resolution?: string;
}
```

### Epic Completion Tracking

- Total stories in epic
- Stories completed vs remaining
- Velocity trends (stories per week)
- Quality metrics across all stories
- Dependency chain completion status

## Quality Gates Integration

### Pre-Development

- [ ] Story dependencies resolved
- [ ] Technical requirements understood
- [ ] Test strategy defined
- [ ] Security considerations identified

### During Development

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests written with adequate coverage
- [ ] No introduction of security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

### Post-Development

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage â‰¥ 80%
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Automated Tracking Commands

### Session Management

```bash
# Start tracking session
dna-cli track start --type=feature --epic=epic-1 --story=epic-1-story-3

# Log progress during session
dna-cli track progress --files-modified=5 --tests-added=3

# End session with metrics
dna-cli track end --quality-gates-status=all-passed
```

### Quality Validation

```bash
# Run comprehensive quality check
dna-cli validate --coverage --security --performance --linting

# Generate progress report
dna-cli report --session-id=uuid --format=json
```

### Friction Analysis

```bash
# Analyze session friction points
dna-cli analyze-friction --session-range=last-7-days

# Export friction metrics for optimization
dna-cli export-metrics --type=friction --format=csv
```

## Dashboard Integration

### Real-time Progress Display

- Current session status and metrics
- Epic/story completion percentage
- Quality gate status indicators
- Friction point alerts

### Historical Analytics

- Development velocity trends
- Quality metrics over time
- Common friction patterns
- Most productive development patterns

### Team Insights

- Cross-developer performance comparison
- Best practices identification
- Common blocker patterns
- Knowledge sharing opportunities

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Git Integration

- Automatic commit message analysis
- Branch strategy compliance
- Code review readiness indicators

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Quality gate results feed back to progress tracker
- Deployment success rates
- Performance regression detection

### Documentation Updates

- Automatic story completion notes
- Progress updates in story files
- Knowledge base enhancement suggestions

## Friction Elimination Strategies

### Common Friction Points

1. **Environment Setup**: Template dependencies not properly resolved
2. **Context Understanding**: Large codebases with unclear architecture
3. **Tool Configuration**: Framework-specific tooling conflicts
4. **Testing Setup**: Complex testing environment configuration

### Automated Solutions

- Pre-validated template combinations
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Standardized tool configurations
- Ready-to-use testing boilerplates

### Continuous Improvement

- Weekly friction point analysis
- Template optimization based on common issues
- Developer feedback integration
- Best practice documentation updates
