   Native components, web unit tests, and Rust modules
2. **AC2:** Automated security scanning with Snyk/npm audit integration blocking
   critical vulnerabilities
3. **AC3:** Code coverage reporting with historical trend tracking and 80%
   minimum threshold enforcement
4. **AC4:** Quality gates prevent template publication below standards with
   detailed remediation guidance
5. **AC5:** Performance benchmarking with regression detection for template
   generation and runtime performance
6. **AC6:** Accessibility compliance testing with WCAG 2.1 AA validation for UI
   templates

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Testing Infrastructure Architecture

- **Test Organization:** Follow framework-specific conventions for test file
  placement and naming
- **Shared Utilities:** Create common test utilities in `libs/shared/testing/`
  for cross-framework use
- **Mock Services:** Implement comprehensive mocks for AI services, databases,
  and external APIs
- **Test Data:** Use factories and fixtures for consistent test data generation
- **Parallel Execution:** Configure tests to run in parallel for faster feedback
  cycles

### Security Scanning Configuration

- **Vulnerability Thresholds:** Block critical and high vulnerabilities, warn on
  medium/low
- **Scan Frequency:** Daily automated scans with immediate blocking on new
  criticals
- **False Positive Management:** Maintain allowlist for verified false positives
  with justification
- **Compliance Reporting:** Generate compliance reports for SOC2, GDPR, and
  security audits
- **Supply Chain Security:** Validate integrity of all dependencies and detect
  supply chain attacks

### Code Coverage Standards

```typescript
// Jest configuration for coverage thresholds
const coverageThresholds = {
  global: {
    branches: 80,
    functions: 80,
    lines: 80,
    statements: 80,
  },
  './libs/dna-modules/': {
    branches: 85,
    functions: 85,
    lines: 85,
    statements: 85,
  },
  './libs/template-engine/': {
    branches: 90,
    functions: 90,
    lines: 90,
    statements: 90,
  },
};
```

### Quality Gate Criteria

- **Code Coverage:** Minimum 80% across all metrics (lines, branches, functions,
  statements)
- **Security Scan:** Zero critical vulnerabilities, maximum 5 high-severity
  issues
- **Performance:** No regression >10% in template generation or runtime
  performance
- **Accessibility:** 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for UI components
- **Code Quality:** ESLint score >8.5/10, no code smells or technical debt
  issues
- **Documentation:** 100% API documentation coverage for public interfaces

### Performance Benchmarking Targets

- **Template Generation Speed:** Complete simple template in <30 seconds,
  complex in <2 minutes
- **Memory Usage:** Template generation <200MB peak memory, CLI tool <100MB
- **Bundle Size:** Generated templates meet framework-specific size targets (2MB
  for Tauri, optimized for others)
- **Startup Time:** Generated applications start in <3 seconds on target
  hardware
- **Build Performance:** Hot reload <3 seconds, full build <5 minutes for
  complex templates

### Framework-Specific Testing Requirements

#### Flutter Testing Setup

```dart
// Widget testing configuration
testWidgets('DNA module integration test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());
  // Test widget behavior with DNA modules
});

// Golden file testing for UI consistency
await expectLater(
  find.byKey(Key('dna-component')),
  matchesGoldenFile('dna_component.png'),
);
```

#### React Native Testing Setup

```typescript
// Component testing with React Native Testing Library
describe('DNA Module Component', () => {
  it('renders correctly with AI integration', () => {
    const { getByTestId } = render(
      <AIComponent dnaModule="openai" />
    );
    expect(getByTestId('ai-interface')).toBeTruthy();
  });
});

// E2E testing with Detox
describe('Template Generation Flow', () => {
  it('should complete AI template generation', async () => {
    await element(by.id('ai-template-button')).tap();
    await expect(element(by.id('generation-success'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

#### Web Testing Setup

```typescript
// Playwright E2E testing
test('complete template generation workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/templates');
  await page.click('[data-testid="ai-saas-template"]');
  await expect(
    page.locator('[data-testid="generation-complete"]')
  ).toBeVisible();
});

// Accessibility testing with axe
test('accessibility compliance', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/templates');
  const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

### CI/CD Integration

- **GitHub Actions:** Configure workflow for multi-framework testing with matrix
  builds
- **Quality Gates:** Block PRs that fail quality criteria with detailed feedback
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track performance trends across builds and
  versions
- **Security Alerts:** Immediate notifications for new security vulnerabilities
- **Coverage Reports:** Automatic coverage report generation and publishing
