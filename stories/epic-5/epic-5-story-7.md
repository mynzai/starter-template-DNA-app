# Story 5.7: Security & Compliance DNA Modules

## Status: Completed âœ…

## Story

- As a security-conscious developer
- I want security modules meeting regulatory compliance
- so that applications are secure by default

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** Encryption module with AES-256, RSA, and key management
2. **AC2:** GDPR compliance with data retention and deletion
3. **AC3:** HIPAA compliance with audit trails and access controls
4. **AC4:** Security scanning with vulnerability detection
5. **AC5:** Penetration testing automation with reporting

## Dependencies

- **Depends on Story 5.1:** Uses DNA engine

## Implementation Details

   - Multiple scan types (vulnerability, dependency, code, container, network, web app, API)
   - Comprehensive vulnerability management and tracking
   - Automated false positive detection and triaging
   - Integration with external tools (JIRA, ServiceNow, Slack, etc.)
   - Scheduled and event-triggered scanning
   - Compliance framework support (OWASP, NIST, PCI DSS)
   - Detailed reporting with multiple formats
   - Real-time vulnerability notifications and alerting

5. **Penetration Testing Module** (`penetration-testing-module.ts`) - 4234 lines
   - Automated penetration testing execution with multiple methodologies
   - Comprehensive test planning with scope and authorization management
   - Exploit framework integration (Metasploit, Empire, Cobalt Strike)

### Architecture Features

- **Unified Security Framework**: All modules follow consistent DNA architecture patterns
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Real-time security event processing and notification
- **Compliance-first Design**: Built-in support for major security frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2, PCI DSS)
- **Framework Compatibility**: Full support for Next.js, Tauri, and SvelteKit
- **Comprehensive Audit Trails**: Detailed logging for all security-related activities
- **Risk-based Approach**: Automated risk assessment and scoring across all modules

### Factory Pattern Implementation

- `SecurityDNAFactory` for centralized security module management
- Module compatibility matrix for dependency resolution
- Default security configurations for rapid deployment
- Framework mapping for compliance standards
- Singleton pattern for consistent security state

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Zero-trust Security Model**: All modules implement least-privilege access
- **Encryption-first**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging for regulatory compliance
- **Automated Compliance**: Built-in compliance checking and reporting
- **Modular Security**: Each module can operate independently or in combination
