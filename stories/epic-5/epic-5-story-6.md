# Story 5.6: Analytics & Monitoring DNA Modules

## Status: Completed âœ…

## Story

- As an application developer
- I want monitoring modules with privacy-compliant analytics
- so that I can track performance and usage without complex setup

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** Application monitoring with error tracking and performance metrics
2. **AC2:** User analytics with GDPR compliance and privacy controls
3. **AC3:** Business intelligence with custom dashboards and reporting
4. **AC4:** A/B testing framework with statistical significance
5. **AC5:** Real-time alerting with customizable thresholds

## Dependencies

- **Depends on Story 5.1:** Uses DNA engine

## Implementation Details

### Analytics Modules Implemented

1. **Application Monitoring Module** (`application-monitoring-module.ts`) - 1342 lines
   - Error tracking with providers (Sentry, Datadog, New Relic, Grafana, Prometheus)
   - Performance metrics collection and analysis
   - Real-time alerting with customizable thresholds
   - Comprehensive error context and stack trace analysis
   - Custom metrics with multiple metric types (counter, gauge, histogram, timer)
   - Privacy controls with data scrubbing and PII detection

2. **User Analytics Module** (`user-analytics-module.ts`) - 1731 lines
   - GDPR-compliant analytics with explicit consent management
   - Privacy regulation support (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, LGPD, PDPA)
   - Event tracking with comprehensive event types
   - User segmentation and cohort analysis
   - Conversion funnel tracking with attribution analysis
   - Data portability and right to erasure implementation

3. **Business Intelligence Module** (`business-intelligence-module.ts`) - 1766 lines
   - Custom dashboard creation with widget management system
   - Multiple chart types (line, bar, pie, heatmap, funnel, gauge, table)
   - Advanced query builder with aggregation functions
   - Report generation in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON, HTML)
   - Real-time data updates with WebSocket integration
   - Access control and dashboard sharing capabilities

4. **A/B Testing Module** (`ab-testing-module.ts`) - 2891 lines
   - Statistical significance testing with multiple methods (frequentist, Bayesian, sequential)
   - Comprehensive experiment management with multiple types
   - Traffic allocation strategies (random, weighted, stratified, deterministic)
   - Advanced targeting rules and audience segmentation
   - Multi-goal tracking with primary and secondary objectives
   - Detailed statistical analysis with confidence intervals

5. **Real-time Alerting Module** (`real-time-alerting-module.ts`) - 2234 lines
   - Real-time metric evaluation with customizable thresholds
   - Multiple notification channels (email, SMS, Slack, Discord, Teams, webhook)
   - Alert escalation policies with automated workflows
   - Alert suppression and grouping to reduce noise
   - Comprehensive alerting metrics and false positive rate analysis
   - Advanced scheduling and business hours support

### Architecture Features

- **Event-driven Architecture**: All modules use EventEmitter for real-time communication
- **Provider Abstraction**: Support for multiple third-party analytics providers
- **Framework Compatibility**: Full support for Next.js, Tauri, and SvelteKit
- **TypeScript Integration**: Comprehensive type definitions for all interfaces
- **Privacy-first Design**: Built-in GDPR compliance and data protection
- **Modular Design**: Each module can be used independently or in combination
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing capabilities for live data analysis
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Generated test files for all modules

### Factory Pattern Implementation

- `AnalyticsDNAFactory` for centralized module creation and management
- Module compatibility matrix for dependency resolution
- Default configuration templates for rapid setup
- Singleton pattern for efficient resource utilization

### Key Technical Decisions

- Used comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Implemented event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Created provider abstraction layer for vendor flexibility
- Built-in privacy controls for regulatory compliance
- Modular design allowing selective feature adoption
- Framework-specific adapters for optimal integration
