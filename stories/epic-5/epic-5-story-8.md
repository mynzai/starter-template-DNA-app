## Status: Completed âœ…

## Story

- As a template user
- I want a module marketplace with discovery and community features
- so that I can find, evaluate, and share DNA modules

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** Module marketplace with search, ratings, and reviews
2. **AC2:** Community contributions with approval workflows
3. **AC3:** Module testing sandbox with safe evaluation
4. **AC4:** Documentation and examples for each module
5. **AC5:** Analytics on usage and compatibility

## Dependencies
