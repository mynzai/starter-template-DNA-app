# Story 1.1: Monorepo Foundation Setup

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a template system architect
- I want a monorepo structure with shared tooling
- so that all templates maintain consistency and can be atomically updated

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** Monorepo established with Nx workspace management supporting
   TypeScript, Rust, and Dart projects
2. **AC2:** Shared ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configurations across all
   packages with AI-optimized rules
3. **AC3:** Unified build, test, and deployment scripts for all templates
   accessible via nx commands
4. **AC4:** Dependency management strategy preventing version conflicts with
   lockfile validation
5. **AC5:** Development environment setup script that installs all required
   tools in <5 minutes
6. **AC6:** Project structure matches architecture specification with proper
   directory organization

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Nx Workspace Configuration

- **Workspace Type:** Use `integrated` monorepo style for maximum shared tooling
  benefits
- **Generators:** Install `@nx/node`, `@nx/react`, `@nx/js` for template
  development
- **Custom Executors:** Create custom executors for Rust (Cargo) and Dart (pub)
  integration
- **Caching Strategy:** Configure aggressive caching for build outputs and test
  results

### Directory Structure Requirements

Follow the exact structure specified in
`/Users/mynzailabs/starter-template-DNA-app/starter-template-dna-architecture.md`
under "Project Structure" section. Key requirements:

- `libs/dna-modules/` must support nested subdirectories for each DNA type
- `templates/` must be organized by category (ai-native, performance,
  cross-platform, foundation)
- `tools/` must contain CLI, composer, quality-checker, migration-assistant
- All paths must be absolute from project root for consistency

### Technology Integration

- **TypeScript:** Use version 5.3.x with strict mode, no implicit any, exact
  optional property types
- **Rust Integration:** Configure Cargo workspace in `libs/` and `tools/` for
  Rust components
- **Flutter Integration:** Use Flutter 3.16.x with support for all platforms
  (mobile, web, desktop)
- **Testing Setup:** Prepare for Jest (TypeScript), Cargo test (Rust), Flutter
  test framework

### Security and Quality Standards

- **ESLint Rules:** Include @typescript-eslint/recommended, security plugin,
  import sorting
- **Pre-commit Validation:** Lint, format, basic security scan, dependency audit
- **Environment Variables:** Never commit secrets, use .env.example for
  documentation
- **Git Configuration:** Set up .gitignore for Node.js, Rust, Flutter, and IDE
  files

### Development Workflow

- **Branch Strategy:** Use feature branches with conventional commit messages
- **Build Pipeline:** Ensure all builds are reproducible and hermetic via Nx
  caching
- **Hot Reload:** Configure development servers for rapid iteration
- **Local Testing:** All components must be testable locally without external
  dependencies
