# Story 3.2: Real-time Collaboration Platform

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a collaboration platform developer
- I want a real-time collaboration template with operational transformation
- so that I can build applications supporting concurrent editing with <150ms
  latency

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** Tauri + WebRTC architecture achieving <150ms latency for real-time
   operations
2. **AC2:** Operational transformation implementation for concurrent document
   editing
3. **AC3:** Real-time synchronization with conflict resolution across multiple
   clients
4. **AC4:** Presence awareness and cursor tracking for collaborative features
5. **AC5:** Performance monitoring with latency measurement and optimization
   tools

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Tauri WebRTC Foundation (AC: 1, depends on Epic 3.1)

  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Setup Tauri with Rust backend and React frontend
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement WebRTC peer-to-peer connections
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Add signaling server for connection establishment
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Optimize for <150ms latency requirements

- [ ] Task 2: Operational Transformation (AC: 2)

  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Implement OT algorithm for text editing
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Add operation serialization and deserialization
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Create transformation matrices for different operations
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Add validation and consistency checking

- [ ] Task 3: Synchronization Engine (AC: 3)

  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Build real-time state synchronization
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement conflict resolution strategies
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
  - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Create state reconciliation for disconnected clients

- [ ] Task 4: Presence System (AC: 4)

  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Track online users and their activities
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Implement cursor position sharing
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Add user awareness indicators
  - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Create collaborative selection highlighting

- [ ] Task 5: Performance Monitoring (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Add latency measurement and tracking
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Monitor connection quality and bandwidth
  - [ ] Subtask 5.3: Create performance optimization recommendations
  - [ ] Subtask 5.4: Setup real-time performance dashboard

## Dev Technical Guidance

### WebRTC Architecture

```rust
// Tauri Rust backend
#[tauri::command]
async fn create_peer_connection(config: RTCConfiguration) -> RTCPeerConnection {
    let peer_connection = RTCPeerConnection::new(config).await?;
    // Setup data channels for operational transformation
    Ok(peer_connection)
}
```

### Performance Targets

- Latency: <150ms for all operations
- Throughput: 1000+ operations/second
- Connection establishment: <3 seconds
- Memory usage: <100MB per client

## Dependencies

- **Depends on Story 3.1:** Uses quality foundation framework
- **Independent platform template:** Can be used standalone
