   testing across platforms
2. **AC2:** Code quality tooling with linting, formatting, and static analysis
   patterns
3. **AC3:** Performance benchmarking suite with baseline measurements and
   regression detection
4. **AC4:** Security scanning integration with automated vulnerability detection
5. **AC5:** Quality metrics dashboard with coverage, performance, and security
   scores
6. **AC6:** CI/CD quality gates with automated quality enforcement
