## Dev Technical Guidance

### Integration Architecture

```typescript
class TemplateGenerationPipeline {
  async generate(request: GenerationRequest): Promise<GenerationResult> {
    // 1. CLI validation
    const validatedRequest = await this.cli.validate(request);

    // 2. DNA composition
    const composition = await this.dnaEngine.compose(validatedRequest);

    // 3. Template generation
    const template = await this.generator.generate(composition);

    // 4. Quality validation
    const validation = await this.qualityValidator.validate(template);

    return { template, validation, metrics: this.metrics.collect() };
  }
}
```

### Performance Targets

- Complete workflow: <10 minutes for complex templates
- Real-time validation: <500ms response time
- Quality checks: <2 minutes for full validation suite
- Memory usage: <200MB peak across all components
